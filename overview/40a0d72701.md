## Original Study Abstract

Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are being studied for their potential to harm humans and the environment. Biological activity, toxicity, physicochemical properties, fate, and transport of NPs must all be evaluated and/or predicted. In this work, we
explored the infuence of metal oxide nanoparticle facets on their toxicity towards bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B), Murine
myeloid (RAW 264.7), and E. coli cell lines. To estimate the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles grown to a low facet index,
a quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship ((Q)SAR) approach was used. The novel model employs theoretical (density
functional theory calculations) and experimental studies (transmission electron microscopy images from which several particle descriptors are extracted and toxicity data extracted from the literature) to investigate the properties of faceted metal
oxides, which are then utilized to construct a toxicity model. The classifcation mode of the k-nearest neighbour algorithm
(EnaloskNN, Enalos Chem/Nanoinformatics) was used to create the presented model for metal oxide cytotoxicity. Four
descriptors were identifed as signifcant: core size, chemical potential, enthalpy of formation, and electronegativity count
of metal oxides. The relationship between these descriptors and metal oxide facets is discussed to provide insights into the
relative toxicities of the nanoparticle. The model and the underpinning dataset are freely available on the NanoSolveIT project
cloud platform and the NanoPharos database, respectively.
