## Original Study Abstract

Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models for nanomaterials (nano-QSAR) were developed to predict the cytotoxicity of 20 different types of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to human lung cells by using quasi-SMILES. The optimal descriptors, recorded as quasi-SMILES, were encoded to represent the physicochemical properties and experimental conditions for the MWCNTs from 276 data records collected from previously published studies. The quasi-SMILES used to build the optimal descriptors were (i) diameter, (ii) length, (iii) surface area, (iv) in vitro toxicity assay, (v) cell line, (vi) exposure time, and (vii) dose. The model calculations were performed by using the Monte Carlo method and computed with CORAL software (www.insilico.eu/coral). The quasi-SMILES-based nano-QSAR model provided satisfactory statistical results (R2 for internal validation data sets: 0.60–0.80; R2pred for external validation data sets: 0.81–0.88). The model showed potential for use in the estimation of human lung cell viability after exposure to MWCNTs with the following properties: diameter, 12–74 nm; length, 0.19–20.25 μm; surface area, 11.3–380.0 m2/g; and dose, 0–200 ppm.
