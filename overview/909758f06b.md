## Original Study Abstract

The physicochemical characterisation data from a library of 69 engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) has been exploited in silico following enrichment with a set of molecular descriptors that can be easily acquired or calculated using atomic periodicity and other fundamental atomic parameters. Based on the extended set of twenty descriptors, a robust and validated nanoinformatics model has been proposed to predict the ENM ζ-potential. The five critical parameters selected as the most significant for the model development included the ENM size and coating as well as three molecular descriptors, metal ionic radius (rion), the sum of metal electronegativity divided by the number of oxygen atoms present in a particular metal oxide (Σχ/nO) and the absolute electronegativity (χabs), each of which is thoroughly discussed to interpret their influence on ζ-potential values. The model was developed using the Isalos Analytics Platform and is available to the community as a web service through the Horizon 2020 (H2020) NanoCommons Transnational Access services and the H2020 NanoSoveIT Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA).
